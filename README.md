## Dataset Description
We have compiled a comprehensive dataset by leveraging web scraping techniques with Selenium and complemented it with existing data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prithvijaunjale/instagram-images-with-captions">Kaggle</a>. At present, we've successfully scraped data from a limited set of 10 profiles. While this initial dataset offers valuable insights, we recognize the potential for further enrichment and expansion when it comes to fine-tuning.

## Features 
- Image analysis using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large">BLIP</a> model.
- Caption generation based on image features and context using <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction">Gemini</a>.
- Customization options to tailor captions to your style and preferences.
- Hosted on Hugging Face Streamlit Spaces for seamless user experience.
